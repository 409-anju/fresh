    <p>“With so many different marketing and sales platforms available to companies, it's no wonder that marketers are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to help them manage their campaigns. AI can help create more effective campaigns by bringing together all the different aspects of a campaign, from customer segmentation to media and creative optimization to automating follow -up emails and messages. In a similar way, sales teams are using AI tools to close more deals by using machine learning to understand what makes each lead or account unique, allowing sales reps to go back-and-forth with prospects in ways that will be most effective for them. By using AI tools like these, companies can streamline their processes and experience better results.”</p>
