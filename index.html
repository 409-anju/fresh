    <p>Git Branch
A branch is a version of the repository that diverges from the main working project. It is a feature available in most modern version control systems. A Git project can have more than one branch. These branches are a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug, you spawn a new branch to summarize your changes. So, it is complex to merge the unstable code with the main code base and also facilitates you to clean up your future history before merging with the main branch.</p>
<p>Git Master Branch
The master branch is a default branch in Git. It is instantiated when first commit made on the project. When you make the first commit, you're given a master branch to the starting commit point. When you start making a commit, then master branch pointer automatically moves forward. A repository can have only one master branch.

Master branch is the branch in which all the changes eventually get merged back. It can be called as an official working version of your project.
